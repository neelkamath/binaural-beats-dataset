    "explanation": "Theta brainwaves are considered to be extremely relaxing brainwave activity that is commonly associated with sleep and dreaming. Theta brainwaves are high in amplitude and cycle within the range of 4 Hz to 8 Hz and are usually generated in the brain's right hemisphere. Theta waves kick in when we feel emotional, relaxed, day-dreamy, unfocused, or are asleep. Theta brainwaves are generally thought of as the brainwaves that are dominant in people with A.D.D., high levels of relaxation, high levels of creativity, and random thinking. The theta brainwave is considered the brainwave pattern that is dominant in deeply relaxed, and dream sleep. Theta brain waves typically range from 4 Hz to 8 Hz. Theta brain waves are associated with the \"subconscious mind\" and are usually produced in the right-hemisphere of the brain - as opposed to beta brain waves, which are produced in the left-hemisphere and are associated with the \"conscious mind\". The brain creates theta brain wave rhythms each time you are in \"dream sleep\". Also, during R.E.M. (rapid-eye movement) sleep, the brain is full of theta brain wave activity. Nearly three-fifths of your entire time spent sleeping at night involves the production of theta brain waves in your brain. Many individuals also are able to access theta brain waves when they are driving for a long stretch on the highway, practicing their meditation routine, using a self-hypnosis recording, or practicing other forms of deep relaxation. When you are able to consciously access the alpha brain waves state, you are just one step away from accessing the depths of theta. What's cool about theta brain waves is the fact that they allow you to connect with your \"subconscious mind\". The subconscious mind is the place where all experiences, long-term memories, natural creativity, powerful emotions, spiritual connections, and inspiration are stored. Think of the \"subconscious mind\" as one big, infinite storage space for \"everything\" in your life. The theta brain waves are extremely helpful for healing the body of injury and the mind of diseased-states.\n",

    "explanation": "Alpha brain waves are considered relaxed brainwave activity. Alpha brainwaves are brainwaves that cycle within the range of 8 Hz to 12 Hz and are usually generated in the brain's right hemisphere or in a synchronized pattern between both the right and left hemispheres. Alpha waves kick in when our mind and body are completely relaxed and free of stress. Alpha is generally thought of as the normal brainwave that is dominant in people who are relaxed, creative, and have a clear mind. Alpha is considered the \"normal\" brainwave pattern and is dominant when people close their eyes. Children tend to have much higher levels of alpha brainwaves than adults. Alpha brainwaves are considered the healthiest brainwave range and 10 Hz has widely been accepted as the \"safest\" brainwave frequency to train. Most children and younger teenagers have a dominant alpha rhythm. There isn't a single brain wave pattern is better than the others, so don't think alpha brainwaves are a \"cure all\".

If you happen to be deficient in the beta brain wave range, increasing them may feel like a miracle!\n Just like anything else, too much beta activity can be a bad thing. By no means would it be a good idea for you to increase a brainwave that you already have high levels of.
